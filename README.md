# Alarm-Clock-Project
The goal of this project was to design and manufacture an alarm clock PCB for a microcontroller and program the microcontroller to have the implemented functionality of setting current time, setting alarm time, enabling and disabling the alarm, switching between 12-hour and 24-hour formats, and optionally a snooze button. The alarm music or tones would come from an external USB stick.
