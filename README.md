# Alarm-Clock-Project
The goal of this project was to design and manufacture an alarm clock PCB for a microcontroller and program the microcontroller to have the implemented functionality of setting current time, setting alarm time, enabling and disabling the alarm, switching between 12-hour and 24-hour formats, and optionally a snooze button. The alarm music or tones would come from an external USB stick. 

Course work\
This repository contains the worked solutions from the course ECE 299: Introduction to ECE Design, offered at the University of Victoria. The solutions, but not the templates, are my own work, and are ***not to be used in whole or in part for any purpose by anyone***. The assignment specification documents are the work of the course runners, not mine. I did not design the assignments themselves. This repository is for documentation and personal review purposes only.
