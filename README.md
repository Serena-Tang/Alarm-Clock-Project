# Alarm-Clock-Project
The goal of this project was to design and manufacture an alarm clock PCB for a microcontroller and program the microcontroller to have the implemented functionality of setting current time, setting alarm time, enabling and disabling the alarm, switching between 12-hour and 24-hour formats, and optionally a snooze button. The alarm music or tones would come from an external USB stick. \

The STM32F407 Discovery board was the required microcontroller which the PCB design and the software had to accommodate. The schematic and PCB were both designed in KiCAD, an opensource EDA, using its Eeschema and Pcdnew environments respectively. The software had to be programmed in the Eclipse IDE for the STM32F407 using C with libraries and provided files. \

Course work\
This repository contains the worked solutions from the course ECE 299: Introduction to ECE Design, offered at the University of Victoria. The solutions, but not the templates, are my own work, and are ***not to be used in whole or in part for any purpose by anyone***. The assignment specification documents are the work of the course runners, not mine. I did not design the assignments themselves. This repository is for documentation and personal review purposes only.

1. If you are currently taking ECE 299, by viewing the contents of this repository you agree ***not*** to use any part of the repository code, which includes but not limits to re-defining all the variables and slight modification of the small details.
2. Using it constitues plagiarism, plagiarism and other forms of academic fraud are taken very seriously by both the University and the Department.
